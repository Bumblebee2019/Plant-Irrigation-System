## Project Significance:
Indoor plants not only enliven the room, but are also known to improve quality of air. Unfortunately, people sometimes forget to water their plants due 
to busy schedules. My automatic watering system will help plant owners by doing all the work for them! A moisture sensor is placed in the plant’s soil 
and once it detects that the soil is too dry, the device will water the plant until the moisture level is normal again. Instead of remembering when to 
water each plant, all a person needs are sensors in each of the plants’ soil and the vegetation health will be taken care of!
